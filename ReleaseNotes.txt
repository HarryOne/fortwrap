- Added support for string arguments that are optional
- Changed interface for intent(in) strings to use character arrays,
  which makes it easier to pass string literals

- Tweaks to function_pointer and array tests for improved
  compatibility
- Correction to manual: FortWrap actually does support assumed size
  arrays
